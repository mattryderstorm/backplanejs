	    This page simulates a blogger mentioning that they have an item for sale, and recommending
	    two books. The blogger need only add a small amount of RDFa, and the Ubiquity library does
	    the rest:
	    <ul>
	      <li>a widget is embedded that gives details of current bids for any items for sale;</li>
	      <li>a Yowl notification is shown for each eBay item found on the page;</li>
	      <li>a Yowl notification is shown for each book mentioned on the page;</li>
	      <li>a data request is sent to the eBay API for more information on each item for sale;</li>
	      <li>a data request is sent to Amazon via Yahoo! pipes for more information on each book;</li>
	      <li>further Yowl notifications for each eBay item and book are shown, using the title and thumbnail retrieved.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <strong>Note that there is a bug in YUI which will cause the eBay tooltip to be nothing but a flashing white box
	      if the browser window is too small.</strong>

	  <h1>My Blog</h1>
	  <p>
      I would really recommend <span xmlns:bib="http://somebig.org/" about="urn:ISBN:0091808189" typeof="bib:book">
        Canteen Cuisine
      </span>
	    and
      <span xmlns:bib="http://somebig.org/" about="urn:ISBN:0226116239" typeof="bib:book">
        Conversations with Glenn Gould
      </span>...they're both great books.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Also, I saw this 
	  	<span about="#a" xmlns:ebay="http://ebay.com/" property="ebay:item" content="160290722043">bike for sale</span>
	    and it might suit someone who hasn't already got a bike exactly like it.
