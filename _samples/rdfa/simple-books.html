	    This document contains sample book information. Below are two sentences that refer to books. These are the
	    'hooks' that the processor uses to:
	    <ul>
	      <li>obtain further information about the books from Amazon, via Yahoo! Pipes;</li>
	      <li>use that information to store a reference to the title and book cover image;</li>
	      <li>use the title and book cover to create tooltips and Yowl notifications.</li>
