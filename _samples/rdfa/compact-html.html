	    This page is used to test Compact HTML messages sent via Twitter. It uses the
  	  account Stooky Bill<span typeof="foaf:OnlineAccount"
  	    rel="foaf:accountServiceHomepage" resource="http://www.twitter.com/"
  	    property="foaf:accountName" content="stookybill"></span>,
	    which was the name of the ventiloquist dummy that John
	    Logie Baird used in some of his first broadcasts of moving pictures.
