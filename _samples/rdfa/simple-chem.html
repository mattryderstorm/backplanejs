	    This file contains a simple chemistry example. Below there are two sentences that refer to chemical compounds.
	    Each compound is identified with RDFa, which provides the 'hook' for the UI processor to add:
	    <ul>
	      <li>an icon indicating that a CID value has been found;</li>
	      <li>a tooltip on that icon, showing its molecular structure;</li>
	      <li>a link that will search the PubChem database when an InChI value is found;</li>
	      <li>Yowl notifications for each compound.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	    <div about="#chem_123" xmlns:chem="http://www.blueobelisk.org/chemistryblogs/">
	      Viagra has the following CID identifier: <span property="chem:cid">5281023</span>
	    </div>
	  <div about="#chem_124" xmlns:chem="http://www.blueobelisk.org/chemistryblogs/">
